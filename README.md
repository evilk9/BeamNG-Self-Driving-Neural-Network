# Need For Speed Convolutional Neural Network

A simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network aplied to Need For Speed Most Wanted. 

This project was undertaken as part of a "Design & Innovation" course for my Electrical Engineering Degree. 

The aim was to propose a solution for a topic of our choosing (Autonomous Vehicle Transport System) and write an engineering report on it. 

Overall the CNN does not perform as well as I want to. More training data samples are needed for better success. 

I intend to continue working on this project once I have finished working on a 3D game engine.
